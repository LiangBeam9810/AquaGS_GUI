## What is AquaGS?
AquaGS is an open source tool for Aquaculture breeding programs with friendly graphical user interfaces(GUI).

AquaGS offers click-by-click running from inputting variant call file (.vcf) to the final mate allocation scheme. No need to prepare anything just except variant call file and phenotype file(.csv).

Everything Genomic Selection(GS) workflow needs are contained by AquaGS, such as preprocessing,effect testing,breeding-value calculating and mate allocating.Users no longer need to switch between software on different platforms. At the sametime, we also provide a simple way to install, try to put a lot of power into your hands by making easy things easy, and hard things possible. 

## How to start?
Following [this tutorial](./Md/Setting_Up_Your_Environment.md), AquaGS can be easily installed by anyone even without programming experience.
