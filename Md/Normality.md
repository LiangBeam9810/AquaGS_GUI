# Normality Testing and Converting
Normality test is performed on the target phenotype, and the function of normality transformation is provided. Users can view histograms, skewness and kurtosis to learn about the normality of the target phenotype.

## Converted Method
Here we use the [The Ordered Quantile (ORQ) normalization transformation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bestNormalize/versions/1.0.0/topics/orderNorm), form [bestNormalize (version 1.8.2)](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bestNormalize/versions/1.8.2/topics/bestNormalize) .
