# Setting Up Your Environment
Before you can build mate plans ,you need to install some software and set up your build environment .This only has to be done once no matter how many mate plans you plan to compile for. 

There are 3 main sections to this guide:

# 1.Prerequisites 
There are only two pieces of software you'll need to get started.
-  [Install R](Install_R.md)
- [Install Java](Install_Java.md)
# 2.[Install packages for R](./Md/../Install_packages_for%20R.md)
Weâ€™ve tried to make AquaGS_GUI as easy to set up as possible.Some of the packages required in AquaGS_GUI can be installed automatically when AquaGS_GUI first run.

# 3.Download AquaGS_GUI
Download AquaGS_GUI to local from GitHub .

At this point, the installation is complete.You are now ready to create your own mate plans ! Enjoy it !
